# WhatsApp clone created in MeteorJS!

## File structure
- `client` - files served from the client side
- `server` - files on the server
- `public` - files served as is to the client (i.e. pictures, fonts, etc)
- `lib` - Anything in the file structure inside of lib will be served first

### MAIN HTML FILE
- `ion-nav-bar` and `ion-nav-vew` Ionic components to automatically add
- Only head and the body are in the index folder because MeteorJS takes care of the rest

### MISC
- Added angular-ecmascript to take advantage of es6's class system
